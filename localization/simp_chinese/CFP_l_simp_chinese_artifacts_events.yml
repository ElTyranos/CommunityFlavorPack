 cfp_title_event.0001.t:0 "A Norman initiative"
 cfp_title_event.0001.odo:1 "[bishop.GetFullNameNoTooltipRegnal] approaches me confidently, as is his usual demeanor. \n\n"[ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip], your reign stands uncontested! The word has spread of our glorious conquest. To rightfully praise such a momentous occasion, we need something unlike anything else, something that will stand the test of time. I’ll return soon, once the details are worked out, and your legitimacy as a ruler will never be challenged." \n\nAs I attempt to grasp what great work he has planned, I’m humbled in knowing this is a person I assuredly can trust."
 cfp_title_event.0001.a.odo:0 "May the Lord bless you in these pursuits [bishop.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]!"
 cfp_title_event.0001.bishop:0 "[bishop.GetFullNameNoTooltipRegnal] approaches me. \n\n"[ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip], you stand as our rightful ruler! The word has spread and such a remarkable feat should be praised. We need something unlike anything else, which will last for many generations to come. I’ll return to you soon, once the details are worked out." \n\nAs I attempt to grasp what great work he has planned, I feel obligated to grant him my lenience. After all, the Pope supported my claim over England."
 cfp_title_event.0001.a.bishop:0 "May god help you to carry out your quest, [bishop.GetNameNoTooltip]!"
 
 cfp_title_event.0002.t:0 "Rule with the Arts"
 cfp_title_event.0002.desc:0 "[bishop.GetFullNameNoTooltipRegnal] comes to inform me about his project. \n\n"I’ve requested the finest craftsmen and artists throughout the land to weave this tapestry, it features embroidered imagery of your mighty conquest of England and tells the tale of how these magnificent victories came to be. It has been named the Telle du Conquest.""
 cfp_title_event.0002.a:0 "Such a magnificent tapestry!"
 
 ## A Burmese traveler might forget his Kris Dagger if you invite him
 cfp_artifact.0001.t:0 "$yearly.1090.t$" # We use vanilla name to confuse experienced players
 cfp_artifact.0001.desc:0 "A man wearing only a colorful loincloth appears before me. \n\n"My name is [traveler.GetFullNameNoTooltip], I hail from a very distant country. I was accosted by bandits just outside your beautiful castle, and I’m scared to sleep outside. Would you be so kind as to host me tonight?""
 cfp_artifact.0001.a:0 "Guards! Remove this beggar from my sight!"
 cfp_artifact.0001.b:0 "Of course, you’ll spend the night in my dungeon."
 cfp_artifact.0001.c:0 "Come, you shall spend the night comfortably in the stables with some fresh hay!"
 
 cfp_artifact.0002.t:0 "The traveler has vanished"
 cfp_artifact.0002.desc:0 "You arrive at the stables early in the morning. It seems [traveler.GetFullNameNoTooltip] disappeared without much of a trace. You only spot some flattened hay and a small cloth wrapping."
 cfp_artifact.0002.a:0 "What's this ?"
 
 cfp_artifact.0003.desc:0 "You arrive at the stables early in the morning. It seems [traveler.GetFullNameNoTooltip] disappeared without much of a trace. You spot nothing apart from some flattened hay. You wonder what his story was for a while, but are soon summoned back to other more important affairs."
 cfp_artifact.0003.a:0 "Farewell, [traveler.GetFullNameNoTooltip]."
 
 ## A local sculptor asks you to kickstart him so he can prove his talent
 cfp_artifact.0005.t:0 "A local sculptor is looking for a benefactor"
 cfp_artifact.0005.desc:0 "A difficult looking man demands an audience. \n\n"My name is [sculptor.GetFullNameNoTooltip]. You may have encountered my beautiful sculptures on the calvaries next to the roads of your domain.\n\nI thought you might want to become my benefactor. Indeed, as my name has become quite famous among your subjects, both of us could benefit from this partnership. \n\nAs proof of my good faith, I would create a unique and masterful sculpture for you to display wherever you wish, showing your immense piety to the world.""
 cfp_artifact.0005.a:0 "I've never heard of you, and you don't #italic look#! very talented."
 cfp_artifact.0005.b:0 "It sounds like a great opportunity."
 
 cfp_artifact.0006.t:0 "Local sculptor ripped me off"
 cfp_artifact.0006.desc:0 "A guard brings me a rock on which a message is attached. \n\n"To the stupid [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip], \n\nYour charity has no equal on this earth. When you receive this note, I will be far away, telling the world how gullible you are." \n\nThe message is signed by the hand of [sculptor.GetFullNameNoTooltip]. There is not much you can do now."
 cfp_artifact.0006.a:0 "My reputation is ruined!"
 
 cfp_artifact.0007.t:0 "Local sculptor has no talent"
 cfp_artifact.0007.desc:0 "[sculptor.GetFullNameNoTooltip] comes back with the product of his labor. You inspect the statue from head to toe. \n\nThe folds of Mary's dress fall nicely and soberly. She holds Jesus in her arms and looks happy, full of grace. As your eyes fall on Jesus' face, you can't help but retch. His eye cavities are empty, his face and nose are simple lines. This is a terrible work and an insult to his holiness."
 cfp_artifact.0007.a:0 "I should have known, leave and never come back."
 cfp_artifact.0007.b:0 "How about you sculpt your nails in my dungeon ?"
 
 cfp_artifact.0008.t:0 "Local sculptor is quite talented"
 cfp_artifact.0008.desc:0 "[sculptor.GetFullNameNoTooltip] comes back with the product of his labor. You inspect the statue from head to toe. \n\nThis is obviously a Saint, or maybe a bishop, but you don't dare to ask whom. The sculpt is sharp with beautiful curves and lines. It will surely impress your court, and the local sculptor will peddle your name alongside his humble but honest art."
 cfp_artifact.0008.a:0 "Nice! Tell them you have my benefice, [sculptor.GetFullNameNoTooltip]."
 
 cfp_artifact.0009.t:0 "Local sculptor is gifted"
 cfp_artifact.0009.desc:0 "[sculptor.GetFullNameNoTooltip] comes back with the product of his labor. You inspect the statue from head to toe. \n\nThis is Virgin Mary. Her hands are joined in prayer and her eyes closed. The sculpting is sharp, with a complex veil covering Mary's head and falling over her shoulders. This is how everyone should see her when listening to the liturgy."
 cfp_artifact.0009.a:0 "I want you at my court so you can promote my name!"
 
 ## Your marshal thinks that a chess set would help, and you can prove yourself worthy
 cfp_artifact.0011.t:0 "A game of chess"
 cfp_artifact.0011.desc:0 "[marshal.GetFullNameNoTooltipRegnal] speaks to the Council. \n\n"I am making decent progress in my task of training our men. However, may I suggest the court invest in a more innovative game in order to provide our armies with excellent commanders? This is a game of chess. Chess is said to have helped many generals achieve victory in battle through strategy.""
 cfp_artifact.0011.a:0 "War is not a game, get back to work."
 cfp_artifact.0011.b:0 "Any innovation that makes our men better should be exploited."
 cfp_artifact.0011.c:0 "It's true, I've played it once or twice during my childhood. We should invest in a nice set."
 
 cfp_artifact.0012.desc:0 "My liege, I found this chess set at the local market. It looks rather basic but there are no missing pieces. \n\nI did not speak the tongue of the merchant who sold it to me, but I think I've figured out the rules. Hopefully, this game will help us achieve victory in battle."
 cfp_artifact.0013.desc:0 "My liege, as soon as you approved the idea, I managed to order a beautiful chess set from a foreign artisan. \n\nWhile it took a long time to gather the pigment, this chess set looks magnificent. I did not speak the tongue of the man and [steward.GetFullNameNoTooltipRegnal] could not find a translator. \n\nYet, I think I managed to understand the rules. This game will surely help us with the art of war."
 cfp_artifact.0012.a:0 "Good work, [marshal.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]!"
